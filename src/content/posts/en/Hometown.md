I braved the cold to return to my hometown, which was more than 2,000 miles away and I had been away for more than 20 years.

It was the dead of winter, and as I approached my hometown, the weather became cloudy again, and the cold wind blew into the cabin with a whistling sound. When I looked out from the canopy, I saw several desolate villages far and near under the pale yellow sky, and there was no vitality at all. I couldn't help but feel sad.

I'm not going to be able to do that! This is not the hometown I have always remembered in the past twenty years.

The hometown I remember is not like this. My hometown is much better. But if I were to remember its beauty and speak of its virtues, I would have no images and no words. It is as if that is all there is to it. So I explained to myself, “My hometown is like this, though it has not improved, and it may not be as sad as I feel; it is only a change of my own mood, for I have not been in a good mood when I returned to it this time.

I came here specifically to say goodbye to him. We have many years of gathering and living in the old house, has been sold to the public with the other family name, the deadline for the handover of the house, only in this year, so we must hurry before the first day of the first month of the new year, said goodbye to the old house of the familiar, and far away from the hometown of the familiar, move to the foreign land where I am making a living to go.

The next morning I arrived at the door of my house. The broken stems of the withered grasses on the corrugated roof were shaking in the wind, explaining why the old house had inevitably changed ownership. The original owners of the houses had probably moved out, so it was very quiet. When I arrived at my house, my mother welcomed me out, and then my eight-year-old nephew, Hong Er, flew out.

My mother was very happy, but also hid a lot of sadness, told me to sit down, rest, drink tea, and not to talk about the move. Hong'er had never seen me, and stood far away from each other, just watching.

But we finally talked about moving. I said that I had rented an apartment outside and bought some furniture, and that I would have to sell all the woodwork in the house and add to it. Mother also said yes, and the luggage has been assembled a little, and half of the wooden utensils that are not easy to transport have been sold, but I can't afford to collect the money.

“You can rest for a day or two and visit your relatives, and then we can go.” Mother said.

“Yes,” she said.

“And there's also Komatsu. Whenever he comes to my house, he always asks about you and wants to see you. I have informed him of the approximate date of your arrival, and he may be coming soon.”

At that moment, a fantastic picture suddenly flashed into my mind: a full golden moon hung in the deep blue sky, and below it was a sandy land by the sea, planted with endless turquoise watermelons; in the middle of it there was an eleven or twelve years old boy, with a silver collar and a steel fork, stabbing at a Badger as hard as he could, but the Badger twisted its body and escaped from his crotch.

The young man was a man of the earth. When I met him, I was only in my teens, thirty years ago; my father was still alive, and my family was well off, and I was a young lord. That year, my family was in the year of a big festival. It was said that this festival would only happen once every thirty years, so it was very serious; in the first month of the year, we offered statues of our ancestors, a lot of offerings, very elaborate sacrificial vessels, a lot of people worshipped, and the sacrificial vessels had to be protected from being stolen. My family only had one busy month (we have three types of laborers here: those who work for certain people throughout the year are called long-time laborers; those who work on a day-to-day basis are called short-time laborers; and those who work on their own land and only come to work for certain people during New Year's holidays and rent collection are called busy months), and they were too busy to do anything else, so he told his father to ask his son, Kua Tuo, to be in charge of the sacrificial vessels.

My father allowed him to do so, and I was very happy because I had heard of the name of Wutu, and I knew that he was about the same age as I was, and that he was born in the first month of the lunar year, and that his five elements lacked the element of earth, and so his father had called him Wutu. He was able to catch small birds with a snare.

I was looking forward to the New Year every day, and when the New Year came, so did the earth. One day, at the end of the year, my mother told me that Tu had arrived, so I ran to see him. He was in the kitchen, with a purple round face, a small felt hat on his head, and a shining silver collar around his neck. This shows that his father loved him very much, and was afraid that he would die, so he made a wish in front of the gods and Buddhas, and put him in a circle. He was very shy when he saw people, but not afraid of me, when there was no one else, he talked to me, so in less than half a day, we became acquainted.

We didn't know what we were talking about at that time, but we only remembered that Tangtu was very happy and said that he had seen many things that he had never seen before when he went to the city.

The next day, I asked him to catch birds. He said:

He said, “I can't. It is better when there is snow. On our sandy land, when it snowed, I swept out a piece of empty land, used a short stick to support a large bamboo plaque, scattered grain, and watched the birds come to eat, I was far away from the rope tied to the stick just one pull, and the birds were covered under the bamboo plaque. There was everything: rice chickens, hornbills, francolins, bluebacks ......”.

I was looking forward to the snow again.

The earth said to me again:

“It's too cold now, so come to us in the summer. We'll go to the beach in the daytime and collect shells, red and green ones, and ghosts, and the hands of the Goddess of Mercy. At night, Father and I will go to look after watermelons, and you will go too.”

“Thieves?”

“No. We don't count thieves here. We don't count people picking watermelons when they're thirsty. What we need to control are badgers, pigs, hedgehogs, and badgers. Under the moon, you can hear the sound of a wild animal biting a melon. Then you pinch your fork and walk gently to ......”.

I didn't know what the so-called Badger was at that time - I still don't - but I just thought it was fierce and puppy-like for no reason.

“Doesn't he bite?”

“He has a fork. When you see a Badger, you stab it. This animal is very clever, and runs towards you, but it tries to run away from your crotch. His fur is as slippery as oil .......”

I did not know that there were so many new things in the world: that there were so many colorful shells on the seashore; that the watermelon had had such a dangerous experience, and that I had known that it had been sold in a fruit store.

“In our sand, when the tide is coming in, there are a lot of jumping fish just jumping, all with two legs like frogs. ......”

The first thing I'd like to say is that I'm not sure how much I'd like to see you! There are endless and strange things in the heart of the land that my usual friends do not know. They didn't know that when they were at the seaside, they, like me, saw only the sky at the corners of the high wall in the courtyard.

Unfortunately, when the first month of the lunar calendar passed and Mistletoe had to go home, I cried out in anxiety, and he hid himself in the kitchen, crying and refusing to leave the house, but finally his father took him away. He later asked his father to bring me a bag of shells and a few beautiful bird feathers, and I gave him something once or twice, but we never saw each other again.

Now that my mother mentioned him, all my memories here suddenly came back to me like lightning, as if I had seen my beautiful hometown. I answered:

I answered, “That's very good! I'm not sure if you're going to be able to get a good deal on this. ......”

“He? ...... He's in a very bad way,......,” said my mother, looking out of the room, ”These people are here again. They said they were buying woodwork, and they took it by the hand, so I'll have to go and have a look.”

The mother stood up and went out. Outside the door there were several women's voices. I beckoned Hong'er to come closer to me and talked to him: I asked him if he could write and if he was willing to go out.

“Shall we go by train?”

“We're going by train.”

“What about the boat?”

“First by boat, ......”

“Ha! That's what it looks like! The beard is so long!” A sharp, strange voice suddenly cried out.

I ate a shock, hastily looked up, but saw a convex cheekbones, thin lips, fifty years old woman stood in front of me, two hands on the thighs, did not tie the skirt, open two feet, just like a drawing instrument in the small feet of the round rule.

I was stunned.

“Don't you recognize me? I even hugged you!”

I was even more stunned. Fortunately, my mother came in and said:

“He's been away for many years, he's forgotten. You should remember,” and then said to me, ”This is the diagonally opposite door of the Yang Er Sister-in-law,...... who owns a tofu store.”

I remember. When I was a kid, in the tofu store across the street, there was indeed a Mrs. Yang, known as “Tofu Shih Tzu,” all day long. But she wore white powder, her cheekbones weren't so high, her lips weren't so thin, and she sat there all day long, and I've never seen such a rounded posture. People at that time said, “Because of Yi, this tofu store sells very well. But because of my age, I had not been sensitized at all, so I had forgotten all about it. However, Marbling was very indignant, and with a look of contempt, as if he were laughing at the French for not knowing Napoleon, or the Americans for not knowing Washington, he sneered and said:

“Forgotten? This is really a noble man with high ...... eyes.”

“That there is such a thing ...... I ......” I said, terrified, rising.

“Then, I say to you. Xun brother son, you wide, moving and bulky, what else do you want these broken wood, let me take it. We're a small family, we can use it.”

“I'm not too wide. I have to sell these and go back to .......”

“You've put away the dao dai, and you're still saying you're not rich? Now you have three wives, and you go out in an eight-carriage sedan, and you still say you're not rich? You can't hide anything from me.” I knew I had nothing to say.

I knew I had nothing more to say, so I shut up and stood silently.

“The richer you are, the more you don't want to relax, and the more you don't want to relax, the richer you are. ......” Yuan規(圓規) turned around angrily, and slowly walked out of the house, tucking a pair of my mother's gloves into the waistband of her pants, and went out. He went out, tucking a pair of my mother's gloves into the waist of her pants.

After that, I was visited by some close family members and relatives. I spent three or four days like this, entertaining and packing.

One day was a very cold afternoon, I ate lunch, sat down to drink tea, felt that someone came in, so I turned back to look. When I saw it, I was so shocked that I stood up in a panic and went to meet him.

The person who came in was Cao Tuo. Although I knew it was Misty at first sight, it was not the Misty I remembered. He had doubled in size; his round, purple face had turned grayish-yellow with deep wrinkles; and his eyes, like his father's, were swollen and red around them, as I knew people who farmed by the sea and were exposed to the sea winds all day long would be. On his head was a tattered felt hat, and on his body was only a very thin cotton shirt, all cowering; in his hand was a paper bag and a long pipe, and his hands were not the red, rounded hands I remembered, but were thick, clumsy, and cracked, like the bark of a pine tree.

I was excited, but I didn't know what to say, so I just said:

I just said, “Ah! I'm not sure what to say, but I just said, “Ah! ......”

I then have a lot of words, want to be like a series of pearls welling up: horned chicken, jumping fish, shells, Badger, ...... but always feel blocked by something like, single in the brain circling, spit out of the mouth outside.

He stood still, his face appeared joyful and miserable look; moved his lips, but did not make a sound. His attitude finally became respectful, and he called out clearly:

The first thing he said was, “I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! ......”

I seemed to shiver; I knew that a sadly thick barrier had come between us. I could not speak.

He turned back and said, “Shuisheng, kowtow to Old Grandfather.” He dragged out the child who was hiding behind his back, and it was the same child from twenty years ago, only thinner and without the silver ring around his neck. “This is the fifth child, who has not seen the world, and is hiding .......”

Mother and Hong'er came downstairs, and they probably heard the voice.

“Old lady. I received the letter a long time ago. I really like it so much, know that the old master came back ......,” said the earth.

“Ah, why are you so polite? I thought you were brother and sister. It's the same as before: Brother Xun.” Mother said happily.

“Aye, old lady, you are so ...... unorthodox. I was a child, I didn't know what I was doing,......,” said the landlord, and asked Shuisheng to come up to him to play, but the boy was shy, and pressed himself tightly against his back.

The boy, however, was shy and stuck close to his back. “Is he Shuisheng? The fifth? It is not surprising that he should be afraid of strangers; it is better for Hong'er to go for a walk with him.” Mother said.

When Hong'er heard this, he came to beckon Shuisheng, but Shuisheng went out with him in a relaxed manner. His mother asked him to sit down, and he hesitated, but at last he sat down, leaned his pipe against the table, handed over the paper bag, and said:

“There is nothing left for winter. This is a little bit of dry green beans, but the family dry there, please old man ......”.

I asked him how he was doing. He just shook his head.

“It's very difficult. The sixth child is now helping, but there isn't enough to eat,...... and it's not peaceful,...... money is needed everywhere, and there are no regulations,...... and the harvest is bad. If you plant something and take it to the market, you always have to donate money several times and lose your capital; if you don't go to the market, it will only rot .......”

He just shook his head; although there are many wrinkles carved on his face, he is completely immobile, as if he were a stone statue. He felt bitter, but could not describe it. After a while of silence, he picked up a pipe and smoked in silence.

When my mother asked him about it, she realized that he was busy with family business and would have to go back tomorrow. Since he hadn't eaten lunch, she told him to go into the kitchen and fry some rice for himself.

He went out, and my mother and I sighed at his situation: many children, famine, high taxes, soldiers, bandits, officials, and gentry, all of which had made him as miserable as a puppeteer. Mother said to me that I could give him anything that did not need to be removed, and that he could choose for himself.

In the afternoon, he picked out a few things: two long tables, four chairs, an incense burner and candlestick, and a scale. He also asked for all the straw ash (we burn straw here for cooking, and the ash can be used as fertilizer for the sand), so that he could take it in his boat when we started our journey.

During the night we talked some more, but it was nothing important; and the next morning he took Shuisheng and went back.

And nine days passed, and it was the day of our departure. In the morning of the first day of the voyage we arrived, and Shuisheng did not come with us, but took only a five-year-old daughter to manage the boat. We were so busy all day that we had no time to talk. There were many visitors, some to see us off, some to take things, and some to see us off and take things at the same time. By the time we boarded the boat in the evening, the old house had been swept clean of all the old and worn-out things, big and small.

As our boat moved forward, the green hills on both sides of the river turned into a darker color in the dusk, and retreated to the back of the boat.

Hong'er and I leaned against the boat window, looking out at the blurred landscape, and he suddenly asked:

He suddenly asked: “Uncle! When are we coming back?”

“Come back? Why do you want to come back before you leave?”

“But Shuisheng asked me to go to his house for a playdate ......,” he thought with his big black eyes wide open.

Mother and I were both a little confused, so we brought up the issue of the tofu again. Mother said that the tofu shi shi Yang two sisters-in-law, since my family packing since, this is a daily must, the day before yesterday Yi in the ash pile, pulled out more than ten dishes to discuss, then decided to say that is buried in the soil, he can be in the transportation of ash, together with the move back home; Yang two sisters-in-law found this thing, their own very much for the success of the dog gas kill (which is the apparatus for raising chickens in our area, the wooden tray above the fence, inside the food, chickens can reach out and eat, and then the dog gas kill (which is the instrument for raising chickens, wooden tray above the fence, inside the food, chickens can reach out and eat, and then the dog gas kill), the dog gas kill (which is the instrument for raising chickens in our area, wooden tray above the fence, inside the food, chickens can reach out and eat. The chicken can reach into the neck to peck, but the dog can not, can only see the death of gas), flew as if running away, thanks to the installation of such a high and low small feet, but even ran so fast.

The old house is getting farther and farther away from me; the mountains and landscapes of my hometown are also getting farther and farther away from me, but I don't feel much nostalgia for them. I only felt that there was an invisible wall on all sides of me, separating me into a solitary body, which made me very bored; and the image of the little hero with the silver collar on the watermelon floor, which had been very clear to me, was suddenly blurred, which also made me very sad.

Mother and Hong'er were asleep.

I lay down and listened to the sound of the water gurgling under the boat, knowing that I was on my way. I thought to myself, “I have been cut off from the land to this extent, but our descendants are still the same, and Hong'er is not missing Shuisheng. I hope that they are no longer like me, and everyone membrane up ...... However, I don't want them because of the gas, all like my hard to spread and live, and don't want them to be like the hard numbness of the soil and live, and don't want to be like others hard wanton and live. They should have a new life, a life that we have not lived.

I thought of hope, and suddenly I was afraid. I had laughed at him when he asked for an incense burner and a candlestick, thinking that he always worshipped idols and never forgot them. Now my so-called hope is also my own handmade idol, isn't it? It's just that his wish is close and mine is far away.

In a haze, a stretch of turquoise sand by the sea opened up before my eyes, and a full golden moon hung in the deep blue sky above me. I thought to myself, “There is no such thing as hope, and there is no such thing as nothing. This is just like the road on the ground; in fact, there is no road on the ground, but the more people walk on it, the more it becomes a road.
